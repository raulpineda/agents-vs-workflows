# AI Applications

  Predictive --> Chatbots --> Multimodal --> Agentic
```

<!--
  Predictive: classification, regression, scenario modeling, anomaly detection
  Chatbots: Just interact with an llm, maybe add memory and context
  Multimodal: Consume images, documents
  Agentic: Let the LLM use tools before returning
-->

# The problem

- I don't like Python
- I really don't like Streamlit
- Agentic apps are too non-deterministic

## Nice stuff

- Open Source
- Typescript-only
- Built on top of AISDK
- Features
  - Agents
  - Workflows 
  - MCP
  - RAG
  - Evals
  - OTEL

<!-- 
  Remark I'm not affiliated with Mastra and that other brands are available
  Building on top of AISDK means that openai, gemini, anthropic, etc is available through the same abstractions
-->

---

# Just a TypeScript class

```ts
// src/mastra/index.ts

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { funnyAgent },
  workflows: { questionsWorkflow },
  // storage
  // logger
  // telemetry
  // mcpServers
  // networks
  // vectors
  // etc
});
```

# Agents

```ts
export const funnyAgent = new Agent({
  name: "funny-agent",
  model: openai("gpt-5"),
  instructions: `
    You are a humorous agent that comes up with witty
    remarks based on some arbitrary input.
  `,
  tools: { humorAssessmentTool }
});
```

# Workflows

```ts
const questionsWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "questions-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({ question: z.string() }),
  outputSchema: z.object({ answer: z.string() }),
  steps: [
    interpretQuestion,
    research, 
    makeItFunny
  ]
})
  // parse the user intent and come up with a plan
  .then(interpretQuestion) 
  // execute the plan using some resources
  .then(research)
  // Summarize the answer and present it as a joke
  .then(makeItFunny); 

  myWorkflow.commit();

  export { myWorkflow };
```

# Let's look at some code

Weather and activity planning workflow as the TodoMVC of the agentic world

# Putting it all together

Let's use mastra agents and workflows to generate a little text-based game.

Some features we'll use are:

- Calling agents from workflows ü§µ
- Looping within a workflow üîÅ
- Awaiting for human in the loop interactions ‚è≥
- Calling workflows from other workflows ü§Ø
